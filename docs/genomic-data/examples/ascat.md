# Visualizing ASCAT profiles

This example visualizes an
[ASCAT](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/peter-van-loo/software) profile
and an allele-specific copy number segmentation along with the raw LogR and BAF
data.

The example has been moved to
[Observable](https://observablehq.com/@tuner/ascat-copy-number-segmentation?collection=@tuner/genomespy).
