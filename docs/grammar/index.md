# Visualization Grammar

Genome browser applications typically couple the visual representations to
specific file formats and provide few customization options. GenomeSpy has a
more abstract approach to visualization, providing combinatorial building blocks
such as [marks](mark/point.md), [transforms](transform/), and
[scales](scale.md). Users can author novel visualizations that display the
underlying data more effectively.

The concept was first introduced in [The Grammar of
Graphics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447) and developer further
in [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) and
[Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/).

TODO: Quick introduction to view specifications. Meanwhile, have a look at
Vega-Lite's [view
specification](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/spec.html) documentation to
get the general idea.

!!! note "A subset of Vega-Lite"

    The visualization grammar of GenomeSpy is a subset and a dialect of
    [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/). However, the goals of
    GenomeSpy and Vega-Lite are different â€“ GenomeSpy is more domain specific
    and is intended for visualization and analysis of large datasets that
    contain genomic coordinates. GenomeSpy tries to faithfully follow
    Vega-Lite's grammar where practical. Thus, this documentation has many
    references to its documentation.
