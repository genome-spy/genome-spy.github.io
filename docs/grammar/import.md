# Importing Views

GenomeSpy facilitates reusing views by allowing them to be imported from
external specification files. The files can be placed flexibly â€“ it may be
practical to split large specifications into multiple files and put them in
the same directory. On the other hand, if you have created, for example, an
annotation track that you would like the share with the research community,
you can upload the specification file and the associated data to a publicly
accessible web server.

### Importing named tracks

!!! missing "Currently unsupported"

    Named imports are currently not supported. Will be back at some point.

GenomeSpy provides a few built-in tracks, mainly to support genomic data
exploration. They must be imported by a name. Read more at [genome
tracks](../genomic-data/tracks.md).

Usage:

```json
{
  ...,
  "concat": [
    ...,
    { "import": { "name": "cytobands" } }
  ]
}
```

### Importing from a URL

You can also import views from relative or absolute URLs. Relative URLs are
imported with respect to the current `baseUrl`. (TODO: Document baseUrl
somewhere)

The imported specification may contain a single, concatenated, or layered view.
The `baseUrl` of the imported specification is updated to match its directory.
Thus, you can publish a view (or track as known in genome browsers) by placing
its specification and data available in the same directory on a web server.

Usage:

```json
{
  ...,
  "vconcat": [
    ...,
    { "import": { "url": "includes/annotations.json" } },
    { "import": { "url": "https://genomespy.app/tracks/cosmic/census_hg38.json" } }
  ]
}
```
